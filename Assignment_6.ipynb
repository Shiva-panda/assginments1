        "\n",
        "Explanation:\n",
        "- In text editing software, users often make various changes to a document such as typing, deleting, or formatting text.\n",
        "    These changes need to be recorded so that users can revert them if needed.\n",
        "- The undo feature allows users to reverse their recent actions, restoring the document to its previous state.\n",

        "WHY STACK IS BATTER THEN LIST  :--\n",
        "\n",
        "1.LIFO PRINCIPLE\n",
        "   - Actions performed by the user are stored in a stack data structure.\n",
        "   - Each action (e.g., typing a character, deleting a word) is pushed onto the stack as it occurs.\n",
        "   - When the user initiates an undo operation, the most recent action (top of the stack) is popped off and reversed,\n",
        "      effectively undoing the last action.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.SIMPLICITY\n",
        "   - Stacks facilitate a straightforward approach to managing undo operations.\n",
        "   - Only the top element of the stack needs to be considered for undoing actions, simplifying the process compared to other data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.EFFICIENCY\n",
        "   - Adding and removing elements from a stack are constant time operations (O(1)).\n",
        "   - This ensures that undo/redo actions are quick and responsive, even for large documents with numerous edits.\n",

        "\n",
        "WHY LIST IS NOT IDEAL  :--\n",
        "\n",
        "1.COMPLEX UNDO LOGIC:\n",
        "   - Lists allow random access to elements, but managing undo operations with a list would be more complex.\n",
        "   - Undoing actions would involve tracking the position of the most recent edit within the list and potentially shifting or\n",
        "      removing elements, leading to inefficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.RANDOM ACCSES OVERHEAD\n",
        "   - While lists enable accessing any element, the undo feature only requires access to the most recent edits.\n",
        "   - Using a list would introduce unnecessary overhead for random access, which is not required for undo operations.\n",
